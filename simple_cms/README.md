Using my Ruby on rails experience I am building my own small scale CMS.<br/>
I am currently working on it, once finished the CMS will support:<br/>

<ul>
<li>user management & user roles</li>
<li>action and view permissions</li>
<li>content versioning and audit</li>
<li>some form of workflow and notifications</li>
<li>normalized database schema design</li>
<li>some form of content import-export</li>
<li>assets management and thumbnail generation for uploads</li>
<li>integration with Google Analytics</li>
<li>automatic RSS feeds</li>
</ul>
